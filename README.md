# Golfing with friends

## Instructions
1. If you can't best "par" of any  open challenge, add a new challenge.
2. you must make up your own challenge, no copying existing golf challenges.
3. Solve your own challenge to create "par"
4. commit, and everyone else will submit their solutions.

## Rules
1. your score is the number of characters (including whitespace) in your solution.
2. only python standard libraries
3. Challenges that ask for output need to be output on stdout.
4. No googling the challenge, python docs are fine.
5. you may reference others work, but I encourage you to start each challenge without looking at others solutions.
